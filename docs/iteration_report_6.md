---
### Roadblocks:
- Meetings:
  - Conflicts with finding a meeting time that works for everyone is ongoing.

--- 
### Adjustments:
- Issues in github repository need minor discussion (Alert messages, design, layout)
- Double-checking to make sure we git fetch and merge before we make a pull request.

---
### Helpful tool:
- Continue - Useful for getting initial ideas on completing a task
- Group Chat - Useful for asking questions and receive quick feedback on our pull requests

---
### One thing we learned:
- When multiple pull requests are active at one time, communication is the easiest way to solve that.

### Work planned, but not finished:
- Everything worked as planned

---
### Roadblocks:
- Meetings:
  - Conflicts with finding a meeting time that works for everyone is ongoing.

--- 
### Adjustments:
- Issues in github repository need minor discussion (Alert messages, design, layout)
- Focusing on getting tasks completed when there are outside dependencies based on a task

---
### Helpful tool:
- Continue - Useful for getting initial ideas on completing a task
- Group Chat - Useful for asking questions and receive quick feedback on our pull requests

---
### One thing we learned:
- If a task has dependencies on other tasks, we need to complete the dependency tasks earlier in the week to have more time overall.
